# Simple Landing Page
This repository contains a responsive and visually appealing landing page created to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates key front-end development techniques, including layout design, styling, animations, and interactivity. It serves as a foundation for understanding how modern websites are built and provides a starting point for further enhancements or integrations. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
